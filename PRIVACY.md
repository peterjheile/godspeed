# Privacy Policy — Godspeed Cycling Team Portal
_Last updated: 10/19/2025_

This website was created to share updates, activity, and general information about the Godspeed Cycling Team. Some parts of the site allow team members to connect their Strava accounts so their rides can be displayed on public team pages. This policy explains what information we collect and how it is used.

## 1. What Information We Collect

### 1.1 Strava Data (only if you connect your account)
If you choose to link your Strava account, we receive the following through Strava’s API:

- Your Strava Athlete ID  
- Your rides (date, distance, duration, elevation, activity names)  
- The GPS route polyline Strava provides (already includes Strava privacy zones)  
- Your Strava access + refresh tokens to keep your rides synced

We **never** receive your Strava password, and we don’t write or post anything to your Strava account.

### 1.2 Basic Member Information
For team roster purposes, we may store:

- Your name  
- Email address (optional)  
- Bio or profile text (optional)  
- Avatar URL (optional)  
- Your team role (rider, coach, alumni, etc.)

### 1.3 Automatically Collected Technical Info
Standard server logs (IP address, browser info) may be collected to keep the site secure and functioning.  
We do **not** use advertising trackers.

## 2. How We Use (and Display) Your Information

The purpose of this site is to:

- Introduce the Godspeed Cycling Team to the general public  
- Let visitors see team activity, progress, and rides  
- Give team members a place to showcase their cycling  
- Display maps and simple statistics about rides

If you connect Strava, your ride data may appear on:

- Your public rider profile  
- The public team map  
- The team rides feed  
- Other public team overview pages

Nothing is ever shown unless **you** authorize it by connecting Strava.

We do **not** use your information for ads, data selling, or automated analysis.

## 3. How Your Data Is Stored

- All data lives in a private, access-controlled database.  
- Strava tokens are stored server-side and are **never** visible to other users.  
- Only admins for the Godspeed Cycling Team can access the internal dashboard.

---

## 4. Disconnecting Strava

You can disconnect at any time by:

- Going to Strava → Settings → My Apps → Revoke Access  
- Using the personal link you received when you connected  
- Asking a team admin/coach to disconnect you

Once disconnected, the site will immediately stop syncing new rides.

## 5. Deleting Your Data

If you want all your Strava data removed from this website, just ask. You can request deletion:

- Through your personal “Manage Strava” page  
- Through a coach/admin  
- Or by emailing **peterjheile@gmail.com**

We will delete:

- All synced activities  
- Your Strava access/refresh tokens  
- Your Strava Athlete ID  
- Your connection timestamps

We aim to complete deletions within **10 days**.

## 6. Public Visibility and Consent

It’s important to be clear:

- **Anyone can visit the site** to learn about the team.  
- **Only members who connect Strava** will have ride data displayed publicly or stored.  
- Riders who do not connect Strava will not have activity shown at all.

You are always in control of your visibility.
