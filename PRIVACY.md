_Last updated: [DATE]_

Godspeed Cycling (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) provides a team-oriented cycling platform that allows riders to connect their Strava accounts and share training activity data with coaches and staff. This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices.

- GPS route polylines (with Strava privacy zones already applied by Strava)  
- Access and refresh tokens used to sync new activities

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information exclusively to support the Godspeed Cycling Team, including:

## 3. Data Storage & Security

- Data is stored in a private, access-controlled database.

- Only authorized personnel may access the internal systems.  
- While we implement reasonable measures to protect your data, no system is fully immune to security risks.

1. Visiting Strava → Settings → My Apps → Revoke Access  
2. Using your personalized “Manage Strava” link provided when you connected

Once disconnected, the App will stop syncing new activities immediately.
